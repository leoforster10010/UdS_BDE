\section{SQL Debugging}

\subsection{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item GROUP BY should be after the WHERE
	\item JOIN should use 'c.id' and 'p.cameraId'
	\item NULL AS NOT\_NULL doesn't provide any meaningful information for this query
	\item 'location' is an ambigouus colum definition. Should be 'p.location'.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
	-- Corrected Query
	SELECT p.location
	FROM cameras AS c 
	JOIN photos AS p ON c.id = p.cameraId
	WHERE location LIKE '%bruecken'
	GROUP BY location;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 'measureOfAge' is an alias for a aggregated column, so it can't be used in the GROUP BY clause.
	\item JOIN on employees is needed for 'experience' in the WHERE clause.
	\item sum() on 's.numGreyHairs' is unnecessary, since it will only sum up single values.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
	-- Corrected Query
	SELECT s.numGreyHairs AS measureOfAge
	FROM seniors AS s
	JOIN employees AS e ON s.employeeId = e.personId
	WHERE e.experience > 42;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{}

\begin{itemize}
	\item HAVING is used on GROUP BY aggregations, should be WHERE instead.
	\item Without aggregation sum() on 'experience' is unnecessary, since it will only sum up single values.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
	-- Corrected Query
	SELECT salary
	FROM employees
	WHERE experience > 5;
\end{lstlisting}
